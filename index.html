                    <p>This project was done through the process of full stack development. First we had to create user stories about what was needed and what would be liked by the users.
                        Then decide on functions were necessary to the program and what features would be neat to have. Next step was to create UML diagrams for classes that needs to be
                        implemented. After the diagrams are created, the next step was to use the  process of test driven development  to create test and figure out what is the correct
                        output. After the project was complete, the final step was to create java documentation of the functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through out the process of completing this project I learn a bit about how to use Maven and Spring-boot API. The project taught me a lot about the brainstorming and development
                        phase of create a application. It also taught me good programing practices that I should use whether I am working on a project on my own or in a group.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project was written using Java, Maven, and Spring-boot.</p>
